            What is the difference between bright, medium and low light plants?
          </Typography>
        </AccordionSummary>
        <AccordionDetails>
          <Typography>
            Bright light plants will do well in direct or strong sunlight for
            the most part of a day. Medium light plants should stay out of the
            direct sunlight. They should be placed in a bright room and will
            enjoy partial or filtered sunlight. Low light plants prefer to stay
            in the shade or to be displayed under fluorescent light. Read our
            Light Guide that will help you to determine the light environment in
            your space before choosing a plant.
